This project attempted to predict student performance based on study hours and attendance using a Multiple Linear Regression model. The results indicated that these two predictors alone do not sufficiently explain the variance in student grades. Future work should focus on incorporating additional variables, exploring non-linear models, and conducting a more thorough analysis to improve predictive performance.
